Running web apps locally

Introduction to running web apps locally

What does it mean to run a web app locally?
Local means you have a webs erver running on your own machine.
It does the same as a real internet web server where for example a to-do-list web app runs. 

Some prerequisites:
You need a code editor. 
You need also node.js. 
We also need the open in browser extension. 

Why do we need that? 
As an example: go to todomvc.com. Download the github repo. We cloned it into our Section_11 folder. 

Go to examples. Search for JQuery. Right click the index.html and click "open in default browser".
You can also open in other browser like chrome. 
What you see is that you are opening a filepath. 
We open the file on our local machine as a web page. 
We can do stuff with that file!
Every functionality works fine on the client side. 

Another example: go to react, and open the index.html again in chrome. 
You see it does not work. 
It is kind of there. You cannot actually do anything. The page is kind of broken. 
We again opened a filepath, but this time it is using the React framework instead of JQuery, so it is building the web page in a different way. 

In these sorts of situations, you need a web server.
Next lesson: how to install a local web server using node and how to run these things loccally so that it all works.
