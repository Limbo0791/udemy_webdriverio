Enforcing Coding standards
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Introduction to enforcing coding standards

We are going to use linting: software that runs on your computer and checks your code 
to make sure you are using the correct coding standards, indentation, spaces and such. 

We will use ESLint. It has a VS code plugin. 
In order to use ESLint you need node.js. 
We have node version 19.9.0.

We installed ESlint from the extensions tab. 
Configuring this will be for the next lecture. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Installing ESLint

In the ESlint extension as well as on eslint.org you can find installation instructions. 

Go to the directory of a specific folder you want to configure.

You can install ESLint either locally or globally. 
Local means the folder where you install it. It is only active there. 
This is for project work. It will not work in another folder. 

You can also install it globally and run the ESLint command anywhere you want. 
The command will be accessible everywhere. 

The command to install eslint globally:
    npm install -g eslint 
YOur packages will be downloaded and installed. 
If you type 'eslint' in your terminal now it should return something. For me it does not. 

We chose to follow the official ESLint quickstart guide:
https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/getting-started

We do follow the course and do a global install using:
    npm install eslint --global

We did see installation activity. 
Npw, in our folder:
    npm init to make a package.json file

Now we create an ESLint file using:
    eslint --init

We can combine npm init and eslint --init in one command: npm init @eslint/config. 

It will ask us some questions: 
1. We will check syntax, find problems and enforce code style 
2. Javascript
3. None of these
4. No typescript
5. Browser
6. Popular style guide
7. airbnb
8. json
9. we want to install extra dependencies using npm 

We see a bunch of stuff, the most important being the eslintrc.json file. 
Now when you open a JS file in the directory where you also installed ESLint, you will see all sorts of errors. 
THis is ESlint doing its work. 
These are airbnb standards appplying to their code. 

You can also list errors from the command line. The command:
    eslint filename.js
the js file should be in the same directory as where you installed eslint of course. 
It will pinpoint all the errors. However, through the VSCode GUI it is a lot easier. 

We will configure ESLint how we want it in the coming lessons. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
ESLint in practice

In the course they use a debug.js file as a starting point for configuring eslint. 
We will use the same file. 

It is a lot of gibberish code full of errors, but it wil;l help us configure ESLint. 
This is how Airbnb develops their code. 
So these errors basically says: this is not according tpo the airbnb standard. 
We will fix these errors and update our rules in the next lecture. 

Just hover over errors and see what it says. 
For example we see functions in use before they are defined. 
Or alerts! eslint does not want alerts for some reason. 
They are ugly but it is more of a warning. 

Another one: Expected linebreaks to be LF but found CRLF. 
This is for Unix type systems, not something we can do now. 
On Windows there is no way of fixing the line break error.

Another one: Unexpected string concatenation. 
According to the airbnb standard, template literals are preferred. 
They also have my preference. 

Learn to google errors. 

Start writing your code in the way it is expected. This saves error correction time. 

The whole point of linting is to quickly see if you did something wrong and fixing it immediately. 
That way your code will always be the way your team wants it to be, which is beneficial for readability and usability. 

Also: do not use var. Use const or let. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Updating our rules

Learning how to update rules. 
Open the eslintrc.json file. It has a rule section. 

Open the file, and also check online the eslint user guide (section: rules).

We will keep the semi colons by the way. 

We only need to check if we can somewhere fix the linebreak LF CRLF issue. 

Bottom line: Using the eslint user guide you can set up your own ESLint rules in the eslintrc.json file.
