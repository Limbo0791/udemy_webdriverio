HTML refresher

Creating a simple html page. See the other file. 

index.html is the basic starting point of web pages. 
In your html file, type 'html' and you see you can choose html:5, select it and you will get some standard boilerplate html. 

The body is your main content. 
html uses open and closing tags with the forward slash /.
<head></head>

The 2 tags, and everything within the 2 tags is called an element. 

Right click and select 'open in default browser'.
We can also use Live Server to open web pages. Every save updates the document. 

You can type the first letter of an element (like the p for paragraph) and hit the tab key and it will automatically create the proper tags. 

Ctrl + / will turn it into a comment. 

Sometimes you do not need a closing tag. For example for input or an image. 

You can have a form, with in it an input of type 'submit', which closely resembles a button.
Buttons can do anything.
Submit is tied to the form and the info within it.
