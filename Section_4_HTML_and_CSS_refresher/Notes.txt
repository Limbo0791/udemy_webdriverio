Introduction

We will use VS Code for the rest of the course. 

Some extensions to use:
    open in browser
    path intellisense

HTML refresher

Creating a simple html page. See the other file. 

index.html is the basic starting point of web pages. 
In your html file, type 'html' and you see you can choose html:5, select it and you will get some standard boilerplate html. 

The body is your main content. 
html uses open and closing tags with the forward slash /.
<head></head>

The 2 tags, and everything within the 2 tags is called an element. 

Right click and select 'open in default browser'.
We can also use Live Server to open web pages. Every save updates the document. 

You can type the first letter of an element (like the p for paragraph) and hit the tab key and it will automatically create the proper tags. 

Ctrl + / will turn it into a comment. 

Sometimes you do not need a closing tag. For example for input or an image. 

You can have a form, with in it an input of type 'submit', which closely resembles a button.
Buttons can do anything.
Submit is tied to the form and the info within it. 

<br> means break: goes to the next line.

Attributes are different things we can give to a tag to give it extra information. 
For an link for example the href, or for an image the src is the source of the actual image.

CSS refresher

Create a style.css file and an index.html file. 
We are writing CSS in a separate file and we will link it in the HTML file. 
For that we need a link tag in the head section of the html file like this:
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">

In CSS you work with classes and ID's as HTML attributes when styling. 
A class is represented by a dot. 
An ID is represented by a hash: #
Multiple elements can have the same class.
ID's should be unique. Only one thing should have that ID. 

Divs: these are just containers that you can style separately.
div h1 {} means looking for the h1 inside the div. h1 tags declared outside the div may have different styling. 

CSS uses classes and ID's and generally known as CSS selectors to style elements on the page.
We are going to use them to find elements on the page when we are doing automation.
